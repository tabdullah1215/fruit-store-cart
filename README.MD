This is a simple shopping cart simulation using React/Redux which demonstrates my ability to use state not only to as a representation of UI but also to track, implement and enforce business rules.  In the case of this fruit cart, business rules include the following:
- customer cannot order more than available inventory
- submitting order results in deducting ordered quantity from available quantity
- items can be deleted from shopping cart
- quantity ordered can be adjusted in the cart after ordering
- order button disabled for items that have order quantity equal to available inventory
- all totals and subtotals respond dynamically to customer actions

Also, this simulation demonstrates my ability to replicate wire frames or UI mocks with minimal specs.  This is apparent upon comparing the rendered UI with the simple wire frame that was provided to me.
