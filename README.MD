This project is a simple yet powerful indicator of some critical skill sets crucial to frontend development related to state management and layout/styling.  This is a shopping cart simulation using React/Redux, CSS3 and HTML5.

This fruit cart project demonstrates my ability to use state not only as a representation of UI but also to track, implement and enforce business rules.  In the case of this fruit cart, business rules include the following:
- customer cannot order more than available inventory
- submitting order results in deducting ordered quantity from available quantity
- items can be deleted from shopping cart
- quantity ordered can be adjusted in the cart after ordering
- order button disabled for items that have order quantity equal to available inventory
- all totals and subtotals respond dynamically to customer actions

Also, this simulation demonstrates my ability to replicate UI mocks with minimal specs.  This is apparent upon comparing the rendered UI from this project with the very rudementary UI specs that were provded, which in this case were no more than a jpeg file.  The two renderings are virtually identical.  The jpeg file is located in the app/src/mock directory
